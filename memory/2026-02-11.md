- Ran YC enrichment from public sheet (`181GQmXflgMCCI9awLbzK4Zf0uneQBKoh51wBjNTc8Us`) and produced:
  - `yc_25_enriched.csv` (25-row enrichment pass)
  - `yc_enriched_output.csv` (3-row yc-enricher test: Leeroo, Red Barn Robotics, Mentra)
- Verified LinkedIn browser auth requirement in OpenClaw browser:
  - Initial state not logged in; user logged in and then enrichment continued.
- Slack delivery attempt to `#openclaw` failed due to integration permissions:
  - `message.send` returned `missing_scope` (needs Slack app/token scope update before file send works).
- User preference confirmed for this workflow: only use publicly listed work emails; do not guess emails.
